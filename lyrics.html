            Maybe, it's the way you say my name
            Maybe, it's the way you play your game
            But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
            But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you
            
            And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
            And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
            
            'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
            And I see forever in your eyes
            
            I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time
            Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
            
            I think that you are the one for me
            'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
            When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
            When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy
            
            And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
            And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
            
            'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
            And I see forever in your eyes
            I feel okay, when I see you smile, smile
            
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time
            Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
            
            Dandelion, into the wind you go
            Won't you let my darling know?
            Dandelion, into the wind you go
            Won't you let my darling know that?
            
            I'm in a field of dandelions
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
            And I see forever in your eyes
            I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
            
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time
            Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
            Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
            
            I'm in a field of dandelions
            Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
